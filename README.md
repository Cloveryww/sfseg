### Key aspects:
1. **Formulating segmentation in video** as a problem of finding the **main space-time cluster**, represented by the leading eigenvector of the pixel-level adjacency matrix of the **video's graph in space-time**.
2. **Fast algorithm: SFSeg** is a **3D spectral filtering algorithm**, that computes the main eigenvector **without explicitly computing the graphâ€™s adjacency matrix**. This transforms the problem into a **tractable** one. 
3. **Refinement: SFSeg** can be used as a powerful refinement method. It is **faster and more accurate** then the well known space-time approach using CRF (denseCRF).


### Run:
- input: input_masks.th (unary term) and features.th (pairwise term)
- output: output segmentation
- sample folder: input_masks.th and features.th maps are a segmentation map (the same)
`python main.py`
